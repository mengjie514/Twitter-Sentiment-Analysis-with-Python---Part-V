    "Vader returns the sentiment value as 3 floating points value in range 0 <= score <= 1, plus one additional compound value that mixes all three in one value in range -1 <= score <= 1. The strength in opinion can be represented by the compound score, which is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). Checking tweets with a small compound score, some tweets are falsely classified as positive or negative but intend to be neutral: \n",

    "Tweets with a small compound score usually have a neutral score close to 1, meaning the text is strongly subjective (neither positive nor negative). The study of 'VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text' (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014) applied the standardized thresholds for classifying sentences and set the values of -0.05 and +0.05. Some texts are incorrectly classified when the compound score is close to 0 but slight over the typical values. In this sense, increasing the typical values to 0.1 and -0.1, the texts shown above will be classified as neutral as it should be so that we can get a better accuracy.\n",
